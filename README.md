Title: Credit Card Dataset Analysis with Python

Description:

The Credit Card Dataset Analysis project is a Python-based exploration of a credit card transaction dataset. This project involves data cleaning and transformation to ensure data integrity. The primary objectives include:

1. **State-wise Spending Analysis**: Identifying the states with the highest and lowest spending using visualizations created with Matplotlib, which allows for a clear understanding of regional spending trends.

2. **Most Common Expense Type**: Determining the most common expense types and presenting the findings visually with Matplotlib, enabling insights into consumer preferences and financial habits.

3. **Gender Spending Disparities**: Analyzing and quantifying the differences in spending between genders.

4. **Yearly Revenue Analysis**: Calculating and visualizing the revenue collected on a yearly basis, aiding in the assessment of financial growth and performance over time.

This Python project delivers actionable insights that can inform decision-making in areas such as marketing, budgeting, and customer segmentation. It provides a holistic view of credit card transaction data, empowering businesses to make data-driven decisions to enhance financial strategies and customer engagement.
